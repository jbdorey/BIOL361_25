# GIS data basics

People are often quite intimidated by working with any data, let alone specialised datasets and formats! Even **Excell** data formats can be scary if you're so inclined. So, I'll try to dispell some of your fears in this section as even "complex" data can be demistified. Much of the data that we are going to be using isn't *actually* complex!

## Raster and vector data



## Projections

## *R* formats

### *sf* (formerly *sp*)

### *terra* (formerly *raster*)



# Read and plot data

## Points

## Vector

## Raster


# Simple analyses

## Extract data

### Vector

### Raster

## 






# What's coming next week?

Next week, we will be extending some of what we learnt here in order to read in GIS data, make some maps, and do some simple analyses.
